		<h2>Todo List </h2>
		
		<h3>Canvas</h3>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Two canvases: a hidden canvas which is the image data of the whole page, and the viewport</s> <b>(13 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> A grid (probably in light blue) to guide the drawing of glyphs:<br><br>
		--- <b>[ ]</b> Should be on its own layer so it can be toggled on and off with ease<br><br>
		--- <b>[ ]</b> Grid width (i think by default 72px is good, thats how big the emoji stamps are by default)<br><br>
		--- <b>[ ]</b> Columns count (my irl graph paper is 30 columns i think)<br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Scroll the viewport with middle click (or right click) + drag. The viewport only has to update when drawing or scrolling</s> <b>(14 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Zoom the viewport with mouse wheel</s> <b>(14 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Export the whole document hidden canvas as an image <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/saveCanvas">(Thank you p5.js for making this easy)</a>
		
		<h3>Brushes</h3>
		<b>[ ]</b> Load brushes from image (the default will probably be a diagonal ellipse for a chisel tip appearance)<br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> "Flick" feature of brush: when the direction abruptly changes, velocity increases and brush thickness decreases. This way hooked line endings look good, and also increases the likelihood that loops will have whitespace inside and not be unintentionally filled in<br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Brush color: doesnt need to be a fancy color picker, I mainly just use red for emphasis/headers and black for everything else</s> <b>(14 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Don't have the start of the brush stroke automatically be low velocity, currently every fast, thin stroke still begins with a big thick serif<br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Compensate for zoom level when calculating brush velocity. Currently when very zoomed in everything is super fast velocity<br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Likewise when the brush sits still on a spot, dont keep making it bigger (maybe it could be optional)
		
		<h3>Stamps</h3>
		<b>[ ]</b> Place classical emojis on the grid, allowing for mixed script classical and cursive texts<br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Also allow placing on the vertical midpoint of the grid for single emoji columns<br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Placing a stamp on the grid while the column has one on the midpoint erases the midpoint one, so that if one decides to add an emoji to the same column and make it a full column, it doesnt leave beind a partial emoji remnant
		
		<h3>Misc</h3>
		<b>[ ]</b> Undo and redo:<br><br>
		--- <b>[ ]</b> Each action must keep track of all the pixel changes; what color it was before and what it is after, and in order to make it simpler maybe the image should be palette restricted. I suppose each pixel change could be an object or a string, whichever has less memory footprint when instanced thousands of times<br><br>
		
		--- <b>[ ]</b> The actions are put in an array; a pointer points to the most recent undo/redo; performing a new action overwrites what was in the redo queue<br><br>
		
		--- <b>[ ]</b> A limit of undo 50(?) actions, or however many until it starts chugging/using up all the memory lol

		<h2>Unanswered questions</h2>
		1.) <s>Is it more efficient to have the offscreen canvas store the document state, or is it better to store it as an array of pixels, and have a single canvas? I am <i>almost</i> (but not fully) certain that the array of pixels is less efficient, because when scrolling/redrawing the viewport canvas, it must reconstruct the image from the array rather than having an image already ready, which sounds like a nightmare of thousands of square() calls.
		<br><br>
		Additionally not storing the document state as a canvas removes the nice p5.js image processing features, like the blend modes would have to be calculated manually per pixel...</s>

		<b>Answer:</b> The <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createGraphics">p5.js offscreen buffer</a> makes this straightforward
