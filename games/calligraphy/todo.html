		<h2>Todo List </h2>
		
		<h3>Canvas</h3>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Two canvases: a hidden canvas which is the image data of the whole page, and the viewport</s> <b>(13 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>A grid (probably in light blue) to guide the drawing of glyphs:</s> <b>(17 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		--- <b>[✅]</b> <s>Should be on its own layer so it can be toggled on and off with ease</s> <b>(17 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		--- <b>[✅]</b> <s>Grid width (i think by default 72px is good, thats how big the emoji stamps are by default)</s> <b>(15 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		--- <b>[✅]</b> <s>Columns count (my irl graph paper is 30 columns i think)</s> <b>(15 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Scroll the viewport with middle click (or right click) + drag. The viewport only has to update when drawing or scrolling</s> <b>(14 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Zoom the viewport with mouse wheel</s> <b>(14 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Export the whole document hidden canvas as an image <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/saveCanvas">(Thank you p5.js for making this easy)</a>
		
		<h3>Brushes</h3>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Load brushes from image (the default will probably be a diagonal ellipse for a chisel tip appearance)</s> <b>(13 Feb 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> "Flick" feature of brush: when the direction abruptly changes, velocity increases and brush thickness decreases. This way hooked line endings look good, and also increases the likelihood that loops will have whitespace inside and not be unintentionally filled in<br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Brush color: doesnt need to be a fancy color picker, I mainly just use red for emphasis/headers and black for everything else</s> <b>(14 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Don't have the start of the brush stroke automatically be low velocity, currently every fast, thin stroke still begins with a big thick serif<br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Compensate for zoom level when calculating brush velocity. Currently when very zoomed in everything is super fast velocity</s> <b>(17 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Likewise when the brush sits still on a spot, dont keep making it bigger (maybe it could be optional)</s> <b>(15 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[✅]</b> <s>Brush sensitivity slider (I like how it feels around 150% zoom right now)</s> <b>(19 Jan 2024 ✔)</b><br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Brush size slider<br><br>
		
		<h3>Stamps</h3>
		<b>[ ]</b> Place classical emojis on the grid, allowing for mixed script classical and cursive texts<br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Also allow placing on the vertical midpoint of the grid for single emoji columns<br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Placing a stamp on the grid while the column has one on the midpoint erases the midpoint one, so that if one decides to add an emoji to the same column and make it a full column, it doesnt leave beind a partial emoji remnant<br><br>
		<b>[ ]</b> Pre-calculate on page load the indexed color versions of the used images. DON'T do this on the fly
		
		<h3>Misc</h3>
		<b>[ ]</b> Undo and redo:<br><br>
		--- <b>[ ]</b> Each action keeps track its bounds. Rectangular area of image that was modified<br><br>
		
		--- <b>[ ]</b> Each action contains an undo image ( what was within the bounds before, and will be restored back to the canvas upon undo ), and a series of redo image commands ( what was drawn to the canvas in this action, and will be restored back to the canvas upon redo after having been undone )<br><br>
		
		--- <b>[ ]</b> The actions are put in an array; a pointer points to the most recent undo/redo; performing a new action overwrites what was in the redo queue<br><br>
		
		--- <b>[ ]</b> A limit of undo 50(?) actions, or however many until it starts chugging/using up all the memory lol<br><br>
		
		<b>[ ]</b> Make sure mouse events only occur when inside the canvas area ( so moving sliders and pressing buttons dont draw on the canvas, mouse wheeling doesnt always have to zoom in and out )

		<h2>Unanswered questions</h2>
		1.) <s>Is it more efficient to have the offscreen canvas store the document state, or is it better to store it as an array of pixels, and have a single canvas? I am <i>almost</i> (but not fully) certain that the array of pixels is less efficient, because when scrolling/redrawing the viewport canvas, it must reconstruct the image from the array rather than having an image already ready, which sounds like a nightmare of thousands of square() calls.
		<br><br>
		Additionally not storing the document state as a canvas removes the nice p5.js image processing features, like the blend modes would have to be calculated manually per pixel...</s>
		<br><br>
		<b>Answer:</b> The <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createGraphics">p5.js offscreen buffer</a> makes this straightforward
		<br><br><br>
		2.) What is the best way to store the actions for undoing/redoing? The outermost layer will certainly be an array of actions, but will the information contained inside the actions be stored as an object, an array of objects, a string, or something else?
