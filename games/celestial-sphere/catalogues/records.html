		<h2>Object with the northernmost declination: Alpha UMi (Polaris)</h2>
		I haven't given as much attention to the northern stars as I have to the south, because there is no rush; they are visible from anywhere in the country.
		<table>
		<tr><th>Datestamp</th><th>Object name</th><th>Constellation</th><th>Declination (J2000)</th></tr>
		<tr><td>2024-03-03 20:52:06</td><td>HD 5015</td><td>Cas</td><td>+61° 07'</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2024-04-18 21:19:04</td><td>Alpha UMi (Polaris)</td><td>UMi</td><td>+89° 16'</td></tr>
		</table>
		
		This record is unlikely to be broken without darker skies or higher magnification equipment. There is a further north star HD 1687 (magnitude 8.1, declination +89°27') that may be just barely visible, but at a perpetual altitude of 20-something degrees, I am not optimistic. I've sketched stars of about this brightness in some of my northern sky drawings, but none are this low in the sky.

		<h2>Object with the southernmost declination: Delta Cru (Imai)</h2>
		Since the beginning of my observations in February I've made an effort to see as far south as I can in the southern sky. This began when I noticed Canopus (which I had probably seen before but never paid attention to) for the first time on 2024 Feb 12. Then with binoculars I began sketching the area on Feb 26, and already on the first sketches there were further south stars, so Canopus never got to be a record breaker.

		<tr><th>Datestamp</th><th>Object name</th><th>Constellation</th><th>Declination (J2000)</th></tr>
		<tr><td>2024-02-26</td><td>HD 47306 (N Car)</td><td>Car</td><td>−52° 59′</td></tr>

		</table>
		
		Gacrux rises high enough (some 6~7° I believe) that I can see it above the roof of the neighbor's house when I am standing back away. Imai also rises above the lower part of the roof, such that I could see it between a gap in the palm trees. Then there is a clearer part of the horizon where Gacrux goes when it is setting, a bit due east and to the right of the house. I saw Kappa Vel in this same place, and it did not appear to set, but rather went across horizontally from left to right, and there are distant trees that it moves behind after some time.

		<h2>Object with the earliest right ascension: Beta Cas (Caph)</h2>
		Most of the objects near the 00h line are set already in the evening sky, the spring equinox having passed several months ago, but the circumpolar stars in the far north cover all the right ascension values at any time of year, so I might spot a closer star to 00h sometime soon without having to wait much later in the year.
		<table>

		Alpha Centauri (4.2 ly) would be closer, and I may just barely be able to see it. I have seen down to almost declination -59° so far and I would need to get down to -60° 50'.

		<h2>Most distant star: ??</h2>
		There are many, many stars for which I do not know the distances, and I doubt that I will have time to find them all. But here are some far away ones whose distances are known:

		<tr><td>2024-02-27 22:37:11</td><td>Tau CMa</td><td>CMa</td><td>5000</td></tr>
		</table>
		
		I have seen further objects, such as Andromeda Galaxy (2500000 ly), which was the first object I sketched on 2024 Feb 25.

		The first time I sketched a cluster (not knowingly at the time) was when I sketched Pi Puppis and surrounding stars on 2024 Feb 27.
