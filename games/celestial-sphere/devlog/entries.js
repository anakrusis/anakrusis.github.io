		"text": "The first question, before thinking about stitching the drawings together, is how to project a single flat drawing back onto the curved celestial sphere. The image plane represents the piece of the celestial sphere being observed as it appears to the eye and is drawn-- as a flat image. Placing it right up against the celestial sphere is arbitrary; the image plane could be anywhere between the eye and where it is pictured below, and it will create similar triangles at the same angles with the eye anyways.<br><br><div class=\"left\"><img  src=\"img/figure1.png\"></div>What I am unsure about is if the distances between the points on the flat plane are proportional to the angles on the sphere, as it is a curved surface so the same rules might not apply. Simplifying it to a two-dimensional model, where the image plane is represented by a chord of the circle, does the midpoint of the chord (representing the center of the FOV) bisect the angle subtended by its arc?<br><br><img src=\"img/figure2.png\"><br><br>In this model the FOV is 45° wide (I tried drawing it with the real 6.6° of my binoculars, but the angle is so narrow it is impractical to draw, I would need a much larger resolution image). Inside the unit circle, the FOV is bounded by the lines y=x and x=0. I made the chord using the slope between the points (0,1) and (√(2)/2, √(2)/2).<br><br>Now the angle at the center of the FOV, bisecting it, is halfway between π/4 and π/2 radians (I am switching over to radians for this) which is 3π/8 rad. And to the point at this angle on the circle, from the origin, gives a line of sight of slope ~2.414... which is 1+√(2).<br><br>And the point (which is supposed to be) of the center of the field of view, is the intersection of the chord line and this new angle bisector line. Desmos graphs out the solution as (0.3536, 0.8536), but this is rounded and I would like the exact value, because I want to know if it is exactly the midpoint. First, that slope of m₁, the chord line, can be drastically simplified:<br><br><img src=\"img/figure3.png\" style=\"height:192px;\"><br><br>So the formulas for the two lines are y = (1-√(2))x + 1 for the chord, and y = (1+√(2))x for that line in the middle of the fov. Now using substitution to get the exact x value:<br><br><img src=\"img/figure4.png\"><br><br>And simply plugging in the x value to get the y value:<br><br><img src=\"img/figure5.png\" style=\"height:250px;\"><br><br>which agrees with the earlier approximation (0.3536, 0.8536). This is that point on the chord which is supposed to be the midpoint. To find out if it is, I took the distance formula from here to the two endpoints of the chord:<br><br><img src=\"img/figure6.png\" ><br><br><img src=\"img/figure7.png\" ><br><br>The two distances are exactly the same. Therefore the point (1/(2√(2)), (√(2)+2)/4), which was constructed from a line bisecting the FOV angle, is also the midpoint of the endpoints of the chord (0,1) and (√(2)/2, √(2)/2). This means that the center of the flat image is on the same exact line of sight as the center of the portion of curved surface which is within field of view. But this may be a special case for the center point, so I would also like to test it out with a few non-center points tomorrow. After that, I think i will feel comfortable with the math involved with plotting points from the chord to the circle, so i might be ready then to try plotting points from the plane to the sphere."
