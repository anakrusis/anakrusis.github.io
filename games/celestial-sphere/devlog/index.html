			Since 25 february i have been making drawings of the night sky as it appears thru binoculars. Each drawing shows the circle of the binoculars' field of view,  and the stars which can be seen within it, usually centered on one of them. Then I center on other nearby stars and redraw again and again to cover a wider area than can be seen in one field of view.
			<br>
			After drawing these samples, I have been stiching them together into maps. The drawings are superimposed such that same star drawn multiple times appears in roughly the same place. Due to errors in my drawings, and errors in the projection of the sphere onto a flat image, two or more samplings of the same star are not drawn in exactly the same place, so I have been eyeballing the average between the points.
			<br><br>
			The projection I have used, if it can even be called that, is a compromise projection that I'm sure doesnt preserve the distances nor the angles properly. The only intent is to minimize the distances between the samplings of each individual star so that it looks right. It works decently for small areas of the sky, but as I map out larger areas of the sky, this is becoming unsustainable. 
			<br>
			The solution is to place the samples back onto the celestial sphere, reconstructing their positions in the sky relative to each other. And they are to be stored along this sphere in three-dimensional space, so that i have the freedom to project them in any way onto two dimensional planes.
