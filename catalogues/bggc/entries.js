To my surprise it is not in a group with #1 and #3; it is twice as far away from us. But there is large margin of uncertainty in this measurement, so I wonder if it could be amended. Its size (46.58 kpc) is based on the distance given, but if that is correct then it is a giant galaxy even larger than #1.<br><br>Three bright background galaxies form a little triangle faintly visible in some hobbyist photos of M101: <a href='img/galaxygroupbehindm101.png'>(See image)</a>"
