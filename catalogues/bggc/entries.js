Three of the sources label it as an infrared source, and the fourth as a star cluster. It may be using the same ID for the cluster of stars belonging to M101 seen above in the photo. No redshift or distance is given.<br><br>It is visible as a diffuse dot in many hobbyist photos of M101, but very difficult to resolve any detail. It forms a straight line with two brighter foreground stars, which makes it easier to find: <a href='img/howtofind_m101-1.png'>(See image)</a>"
