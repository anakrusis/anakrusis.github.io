		I've still been thinking about this passage from ꜥOnchsheshonqy (P. BM EA 10508 XIII.x+8-9) which we discussed last month in chat:<br><br>

		"The/A mother is the one who gives birth; the/a road is that which gives a companion.<br>All men acquire property; the/a wise man is the one who knows how to conserve it." [c]two-12[/c]<br><br>
		ℝandy gave an excellent vocalization of the passage based on the Sahidic Coptic descendants of the words:<br><br>
		[k]ⲧⲙⲁⲁⲩ ⲧⲉⲧⲙⲓⲥⲉ; ⲧⲙⲟⲉⲓⲧ ⲧⲉⲧϯ-ⲉⲣⲏⲩ.<br>
		[...] ⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲛⲓⲙ ϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲛⲕⲁ; ⲣⲱⲙⲉ [ϣ] ⲡⲉⲧϣⲟⲣϫϥ̄.[/k]<br><br>Their work is a great starting point towards further discussion on the vocalization of this Demotic text. All of the words given are more or less correctly identified; I propose some minor adjustments to the forms of certain words:<br>• [k]ⲉⲣⲏⲩ[/k] is derived from the plural <i>ỉrỉ.w</i> [c]ce-38[/c]; the singular <i>ỉrỉ</i> survives as [k]ⲏⲣ[/k] "friend, companion" (not in Crum) [c]ce-42[/c] [c]cdo-C793[/c].<br>• <i>rmṯ-rḫ</i> "wise man" survives in Coptic as [k]ⲣⲙ̄ⲣⲁϣ[/k] "mild, gentle person" [c]cd-308a[/c] [c]ce-142[/c] [c]cdo-C3218[/c].<br>• The vocalization of the verbs <i>tỉ</i> "give, cause" and <i>ḫpr</i> "become, happen", which indeed survive in the infinitive form as [k]ϯ[/k] [c]ce-178[/c] and [k]ϣⲱⲡⲉ[/k] [c]ce-249[/c] respectively, must be of a different form in the sentence[d]𓐍:𓂋𓀁° 𓏲:𓏏𓏤 𓂋:𓍿𓀀𓏪 𓎟:𓏏 𓆣:𓂋𓏲 𓈖:𓎡:𓏏*𓏰𓏭:𓏛[/d]<i>ḫr tỉ rmṯ nb ḫpr nkt</i> for reasons which will be discussed below. For now they will be left as "[k][...][/k]".<br><br>
		
		[k]ⲧⲙⲁⲁⲩ ⲧⲉⲧⲙⲓⲥⲉ; ⲧⲙⲟⲉⲓⲧ ⲧⲉⲧϯ-ⲏⲣ.<br>
		[...] [...] ⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲛⲓⲙ [...] ⲛⲕⲁ; ⲣⲙ̄ⲣⲁϣ ⲡⲉⲧϣⲟⲣϫϥ̄.[/k]<br><br>
		
		This passage consists of three cleft sentences which correspond closely with Coptic, and an aorist sentence which does not correspond straightforwardly with Coptic, but can probably be reconstructed based on the evidence that exists.
		
		<h3>The aorist prefix <i>ḫr</i></h3>
		
		In Demotic the aorist was usually written as <i>ḫr</i> + (a verb in the <i>sḏm⸗f</i> form). A periphrastic form <i>ḫr</i> + (<i>ỉr</i> "do" in <i>sḏm⸗f</i> form) + (a verb in the infinitive) also existed and became increasingly common in the Roman period [c]dvs-87[/c]. It is the periphrastic form that survives in Coptic as [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ϣⲁ⸗[/k] [c]ce-251[/c] [c]vy-269a[/c]. The non-periphrastic <i>ḫr</i> + <i>sḏm⸗f</i> form is the one found in this passage, and it does not survive in Coptic, so the pronunciation must be reconstructed.<br><br>
		
		The main point of uncertainty here is the vowel quality of <i>ḫr</i>. Unstressed auxiliary verbs such as <i>ỉr⸗f</i> tend to be strongly reduced such that multiple vowels become one; for example Allen reconstructs /i.ri.af.'sa.ḏam/ > [k]ⲁϥⲥⲱⲧⲙ[/k]  [c]aep-136[/c]. There is a possibility that the surviving Coptic forms [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ϣⲁ⸗[/k] may be so reduced that they provide no information on the vowel quality of <i>ḫr</i>.<br><br>
		
		It may be useful to compare other examples where a particle is found attached to <i>ỉr⸗f</i>; especially those where the non-attached form survives as well, to see how the vowel quality is affected:<br>• The optative[d]𓅓𓇋𓇋𓏲[/d]<i>my</i> (&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁ-[/k]&nbsp;) and its periphrastic form[d]𓅓𓇋𓇋𓏲𓁹:𓂋*𓏭𓇋𓏲[/d]<i>my ỉrỉ</i> (&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ-[/k],&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k]&nbsp;) both survive in Coptic [c]ce-77, 88[/c] [c]dvs-139-142[/c]. The vowel quality of the first syllable is unchanged.

		<h3>The prospective / subjunctive <i>sḏm⸗f</i></h3>
