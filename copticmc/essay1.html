		I've still been thinking about this passage from ꜥOnchsheshonqy (P. BM EA 10508 XIII.x+8-9) which we discussed in chat last month:<br><br>

		ℝandy gave an excellent vocalization of the passage based on the Sahidic Coptic descendants of the words:<br><br>
		[k]ⲧⲙⲁⲁⲩ ⲧⲉⲧⲙⲓⲥⲉ; ⲧⲙⲟⲉⲓⲧ ⲧⲉⲧϯ-ⲉⲣⲏⲩ.<br>
		[...] ⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲛⲓⲙ ϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲛⲕⲁ; ⲣⲱⲙⲉ [ϣ] ⲡⲉⲧϣⲟⲣϫϥ̄.[/k]<br><br>Their work is a great starting point towards further discussion on the vocalization of this Demotic text. All of the words given are more or less correctly identified; I propose some minor adjustments to the forms of certain words:<br>• [k]ⲉⲣⲏⲩ[/k] is derived from the plural <i>ỉrỉ.w</i> [c]ce-38[/c]; the singular <i>ỉrỉ</i> survives as [k]ⲏⲣ[/k] "friend, companion" (not in Crum) [c]ce-42[/c] [c]cdo-C793[/c].<br>• <i>rmṯ-rḫ</i> "wise man" survives in Coptic as [k]ⲣⲙ̄ⲣⲁϣ[/k] "mild, gentle person" [c]cd-308a[/c] [c]ce-142[/c] [c]cdo-C3218[/c].<br>• The vocalization of the verbs <i>tỉ</i> "give, cause" and <i>ḫpr</i> "become, happen", which indeed survive in the infinitive form as [k]ϯ[/k] [c]ce-178[/c] and [k]ϣⲱⲡⲉ[/k] [c]ce-249[/c] respectively, must be of different forms in the sentence[d]𓐍:𓂋𓀁° 𓏲:𓏏𓏤 𓂋:𓍿𓀀𓏪 𓎟:𓏏 𓆣:𓂋𓏲 𓈖:𓎡:𓏏*𓏰𓏭:𓏛[/d]<i>ḫr tỉ rmṯ nb ḫpr nkt</i>, for reasons which will be discussed below. For now they will be left as "[k][...][/k]".<br><br>
		
		[k]ⲧⲙⲁⲁⲩ ⲧⲉⲧⲙⲓⲥⲉ; ⲧⲙⲟⲉⲓⲧ ⲧⲉⲧϯ-ⲏⲣ.<br>
		[...] [...] ⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲛⲓⲙ [...] ⲛⲕⲁ; ⲣⲙ̄ⲣⲁϣ ⲡⲉⲧϣⲟⲣϫϥ̄.[/k]<br><br>
		
		This passage consists of three cleft sentences which correspond closely with Coptic, and an aorist sentence which does not correspond straightforwardly with Coptic, but can probably be reconstructed based on the evidence that exists. 
		
		<h3>Vocalizing the aorist prefix <i>ḫr</i></h3>
		
		In Demotic the aorist was usually written as <i>ḫr</i> + [i]a verb in the <i>sḏm⸗f</i> form[/i]. A periphrastic form <i>ḫr</i> + <i>ỉr</i> ("do" in <i>sḏm⸗f</i> form) + [i]a verb in the infinitive[/i] also existed and became increasingly common in the Roman period [c]dvs-87[/c]. It is the periphrastic form that survives in Coptic as [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ϣⲁ⸗[/k] [c]ce-251[/c] [c]vy-269a[/c]. The non-periphrastic <i>ḫr</i> + <i>sḏm⸗f</i> form is the one found in this passage, and it does not survive in Coptic, so the pronunciation must be reconstructed. The first uncertainty to look for is the vowel quality of <i>ḫr</i>.<br><br>
		
		First, the aorist forms in different Coptic dialects should be compared. Sahidic and Bohairic both have [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ϣⲁ⸗[/k], and Fayyumic is similarly [k]ϣⲁⲗⲉ-[/k], [k]ϣⲁ⸗[/k]. Sahidic also has some unusual forms attested [k]ⲉϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ⲛϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ⲛϣⲁ⸗[/k] (this one in Fayyumic too).<br>
		Akhmimic and related dialects preserve a less reduced prepronominal form: Akhmimic [k]ⳉⲁⲣⲉ-[/k],  [k]ⳉⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k], Subakhmimic [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k],  [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k], and also Akhmimic-influenced Sahidic [k]ⲉϣⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k] [c]cd-583a[/c]. This is the more conservative form [c]dvs-95[/c].<br>In all of these, the vowel immediately following [k]ϣ/ⳉ[/k] is consistently [k]ⲁ[/k] in both the pronominal and prepronominal forms, and between all dialects.<br><br>
		
		Because all of the above Coptic forms are derived from the periphrastic <i>ḫr ỉr⸗f</i>, they may not provide enough information to deduce the vowel quality of <i>ḫr</i> alone. Vowel reduction is very likely. This is seen in similar situations with auxiliary verbs; for example Allen reconstructs <i>ỉr⸗f sḏm</i> /i.ri.af.'sa.ḏam/ > [k]ⲁϥⲥⲱⲧⲙ[/k]  [c]aep-136[/c].<br>
		So it may be useful to compare other examples where a particle is attached to <i>ỉr⸗f</i>; especially those where the non-attached form survives as well, to see how the vowel quality is affected by the neighboring <i>ỉr⸗f</i>, and by possible vowel reduction.
		
		<h4>Comparison of other [i]particle[/i] + <i>ỉr⸗f</i> forms</h4>
		
		• The negative aorist was periphrastic <i>bw ỉr⸗f</i> + [i]verb in infinitive[/i] in Demotic [c]dvs-96-99[/c]. Its Coptic descendants show variation in the first vowel. [k]ⲙⲉⲣⲉ-, ⲙⲉ⸗ [/k] are the usual Sahidic forms (and attested somewhere in Fayyumic as well); Akhmimic (and somewhere in Sahidic) has [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ-, ⲙⲁ⸗[/k]; Fayyumic has [k]ⲙⲉⲗⲉ-[/k]; Bohairic [k]ⲙⲡⲁⲣⲉ-, ⲙⲡⲁ⸗[/k] [c]cd-182b[/c] [c]ce-88[/c] [c]vy-119[/c].<br>
		As an exception, the Demotic verb <i>bw ỉr-rḫ⸗f</i> "not know" in the aorist is of the non-periphrastic form <i>bw</i> + [i]verb in sḏm⸗f[/i]. [c]dvs-10[/c] This survives in Coptic [c]ce-96[/c] [c]vy-119[/c]: Sahidic [k]ⲙⲉϣⲉ-, ⲙⲉϣⲁ⸗[/k] and Akhmimic [k]ⲙⲉⳉⲉ⸗[/k] (once) [c]cd-201b[/c] [c]vy-128[/c]. Vycichl divides the word as [k]ⲙ-[/k] (negation) and [k]ⲉϣⲁ⸗[/k] (the verb), so the vowel in <i>bw</i> is probably completely reduced.<br>Johnson suggests that the use of <i>ỉr-rḫ</i> instead of <i>rḫ</i> may be a metathesis of subject and infinitive, or it may be a phonetic spelling where <i>ỉr-rḫ</i>&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]ⲉϣ[/k] and <i>rḫ</i>&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]ϣ[/k] [c]two-92[/c].<br><br>
		
		• The optative[d]𓅓𓇋𓇋𓏲[/d]<i>my</i> [i]<i>verb in sḏm⸗f</i>[/i] (&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁ-[/k]&nbsp;) and its periphrastic form <i>my ỉr⸗f</i> [i]verb in infinitive[/i] (&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ-[/k],&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k]&nbsp;) both survive in Coptic [c]ce-77, 88[/c] [c]dvs-139-142[/c]. All dialects have the same vowels in [k]ⲙⲁ-[/k] [c]cd-155b[/c] and [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ-[/k] (Fayyumic [k]ⲙⲁⲗⲉ-[/k]) [c]cd-182b[/c].<br>
		
		In addition to the unstressed <i>ỉr⸗</i> verb in [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ-[/k],&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k], Coptic also preserves this same verb in a stressed position in [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲟⲛ[/k] "let us (go)" (&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>my ỉr⸗n</i>&nbsp;) [c]cd-182b[/c] [c]lambdin-135[/c].
		The vowel quality [k]ⲁ[/k] in the first syllable does not change here whether <i>ỉr⸗n</i> is stressed (as in [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲟⲛ[/k]) or unstressed (as in [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉⲛ- / ⲙⲁⲣⲛ̄-[/k]).<br>
		
		Additionally, <i>my</i> survives in its stressed form as Bohairic [k]ⲙⲟⲓ[/k]; nonstandard Fayyumic [k]ⲙⲁⲓ [/k] [c]cd-159a[/c] [c]ep-276[/c] [c]vy-103[/c].
		<br><br>
		
		• The temporal is another construction which had a particle <i>n-ḏr.t</i> + [i]verb in sḏm⸗f[/i], and whose periphrastic form <i>n-ḏr.t ỉr⸗f</i> + [i]verb in infinitive[/i]  is all that survives in Coptic [k]ⲛⲧⲉⲣⲉ-, ⲛⲧⲉⲣⲉ⸗[/k] [c]dvs-147-149[/c] [c]two-81[/c]. The particle had many spelling variations; in ꜥOnchsheshonqy [d]𓈖2:𓏏:𓄿𓏭[/d]<i>n-tꜣỉ</i>, and in other texts [d]𓅓1𓏲:𓏏[/d]<i>mtw</i>, the same as the conjunctive (&nbsp;>&nbsp;Coptic&nbsp;[k]ⲛⲧⲉ-[/k]&nbsp;[c]ce-111[/c]&nbsp;). These spellings suggest, as Černy gives, that the particle by itself was pronounced [k]*ⲛⲧⲉ-[/k] as well [c]ce-112[/c].<br>
		
		This temporal form is not used in all Coptic dialects, and it is not consistently vocalized among the dialects in which it is attested: Sahidic [k]ⲛⲧⲉⲣⲉ-[/k], Akhmimic [k](ⲛ)ⲧⲁⲣⲉ-[/k] [c]cd-232a[/c]. Bohairic uses a different construction for this, the focalized or second perfect [k]ⲉⲧⲁ-[/k].
		
		<h4><i>ỉr⸗f</i> is not one but several forms</h4>
		
		Returning to the original question "What is the vowel quality of <i>ḫr</i>?": is the [k]ⲁ[/k] in [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-/ⳉⲁⲣⲉ-[/k] derived from the vowel of <i>ḫr</i> (&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]*ϣⲁ-/ⳉⲁ-?[/k]&nbsp;), or is it from <i>ỉr⸗f</i> (&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]*-ⲁⲣⲉ-?[/k]&nbsp;) — or both? Answering this question is complicated by the fact that the above <i>ỉr⸗f</i> examples are actually of several differently vocalized <i>sḏm⸗f</i> forms.<br><br>
		There are three separate verb forms in Demotic which are all written <i>sḏm⸗f</i>: the indicative/past <i>sḏm⸗f</i>, the aorist <i>sḏm⸗f</i>, and the prospective <i>sḏm⸗f</i> [c]dvs-11[/c] [c]two-19-21[/c]. The ones of interest here are the aorist and prospective— both are used in the passage in question, and both are also used in the periphrastic and non-periphrastic verb form examples.<br>
		
		• The aorist <i>sḏm⸗f</i> is used in the aorist and negative aorist tenses- both the periphrastic (where the verb <i>ỉr⸗f</i> is of this form) and non-periphrastic (where another verb is of this form). <br>
		
		• The prospective <i>sḏm⸗f</i> is used in many ways, but of the examples above it is used with the optative and temporal [c]two-21[/c]- again both the periphrastic and non-periphrastic forms.
		
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		
		Here is a table which summarizes these <i>ỉr⸗f</i> forms, their Coptic descendants, and also the sound correspondences of the vowel in question (the penultimate vowel, i.e. the [k]ⲁ[/k] in [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k]):

		Even when tenses share the same <i>ỉr⸗f</i> forms, the vowel of interest can still regularly differ. This suggests that the Coptic reflex of this vowel is not solely influenced by the form of <i>ỉr⸗f</i>, but by the presence of another sound. The [k]ⲁ[/k] and [k]ⲉ/ⲁ[/k] sound correspondence groups may entirely derive from two different vowel qualities in the preceding particle, or they may derive from interactions of the vowels of both the particle and the first vowel of <i>ỉr⸗f</i>, perhaps reduced and coalesced into the single vowels seen in Coptic. In order to understand the interaction between the vowels, the vocalization of <i>ỉr⸗f</i> must be reconstructed as well.
		
		<h3>Vocalizing the aorist <i>sḏm⸗f</i></h3>
		
		<h4>In <i>ḫr ỉr⸗f</i>, in order to vocalize <i>ḫr</i>:</h4>
		
		As discussed above, in Demotic, the verb following the aorist particles <i>ḫr</i> and <i>bw</i> was a verb in the <i>sdm⸗f</i>. There is evidence that this form was vocalized differently than the prospective <i>sdm⸗f</i>.<br>
		First, the aorist <i>sdm⸗f</i> was sometimes written with[d]𓇋𓏲[/d]<i>e</i> before a prepronominal subject, whereas the prospective <i>sdm⸗f</i> only was written in this way before a nominal subject. [c]dvs-11[/c]<br>
		This lines up with the vocalization of the previously mentioned Coptic [k]ⲙⲉϣⲁⲕ[/k] (SB), [k]ⲙⲉⳉⲉⲕ[/k] (A) (&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>bw rḫ⸗k</i>&nbsp;), which is a surviving negative aorist <i>sdm⸗f</i> verb. Vycichl reconstructs the verb portion <i>rḫ⸗k</i> as <i>*(ĕ)rḫi⸗k, *(ĕ)ꜣḫi⸗k</i>, and following the same pattern, he also reconstructs the verb <i>ỉr⸗k</i> as <i>*(ĕ)ỉri⸗k</i> [c]vy-119[/c].<br>
		The expected Coptic reflexes, in the stressed position, would be prepronominal [k]*(ⲉ)ⲣⲁ⸗[/k] (SB), [k]*(ⲉ)ⲣⲉ⸗[/k] (A), and unstressed [k]*(ⲉ)ⲣⲉ⸗[/k] (SAB). Still following the vocalization pattern of [k]ⲙⲉϣⲉ-[/k], the prenominal would probably be unstressed [k]*(ⲉ)ⲣⲉ-[/k] also. This is supported by the final vowel of the prenominal [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k] and [k]ⲙⲉⲣⲉ-[/k], and the more conservative forms of the prepronominal [k]ⳉⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k], [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k] as well (the others, such as [k]ϣⲁ⸗[/k], [k]ⲙⲉ⸗[/k], are so reduced that it seems impossible to tell).<br>
		But while the final vowel can be explained in this way, it fails to explain the penultimate vowel, the [k]ⲁ[/k] in  [k]ⳉⲁⲣⲉ- / ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k]. 

		<h4>In <i>ḫr tỉ</i>:</h4>

		The aorist <i>sḏm⸗f</i> is also the form which <i>tỉ</i> takes in the third sentence of the passage.
		
		<h3>Vocalizing the prospective <i>sḏm⸗f</i></h3>
		
		In a causative sentence such as <i>tỉ ... ḫpr </i>[i]noun[/i] "cause that [i]noun[/i] comes into being, i.e. acquire [i]noun[/i]", the second verb is a prospective <i>sḏm⸗f</i> [c]two-84[/c]. The vocalization of this construction is preserved in Coptic in the form of the large T-causative family of infinitives. [c]lambdin-112-114[/c]
