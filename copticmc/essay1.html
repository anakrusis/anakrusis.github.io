		I've still been thinking about this passage from ꜥOnchsheshonqy (P. BM EA 10508 XIII.x+8-9) which we discussed last month in chat:<br><br>

		ℝandy gave an excellent vocalization of the passage based on the Sahidic Coptic descendants of the words:<br><br>
		[k]ⲧⲙⲁⲁⲩ ⲧⲉⲧⲙⲓⲥⲉ; ⲧⲙⲟⲉⲓⲧ ⲧⲉⲧϯ-ⲉⲣⲏⲩ.<br>
		[...] ⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲛⲓⲙ ϣⲱⲡⲉ ⲛⲕⲁ; ⲣⲱⲙⲉ [ϣ] ⲡⲉⲧϣⲟⲣϫϥ̄.[/k]<br><br>Their work is a great starting point towards further discussion on the vocalization of this Demotic text. All of the words given are more or less correctly identified; I propose some minor adjustments to the forms of certain words:<br>• [k]ⲉⲣⲏⲩ[/k] is derived from the plural <i>ỉrỉ.w</i> [c]ce-38[/c]; the singular <i>ỉrỉ</i> survives as [k]ⲏⲣ[/k] "friend, companion" (not in Crum) [c]ce-42[/c] [c]cdo-C793[/c].<br>• <i>rmṯ-rḫ</i> "wise man" survives in Coptic as [k]ⲣⲙ̄ⲣⲁϣ[/k] "mild, gentle person" [c]cd-308a[/c] [c]ce-142[/c] [c]cdo-C3218[/c].<br>• The vocalization of the verbs <i>tỉ</i> "give, cause" and <i>ḫpr</i> "become, happen", which indeed survive in the infinitive form as [k]ϯ[/k] [c]ce-178[/c] and [k]ϣⲱⲡⲉ[/k] [c]ce-249[/c] respectively, must be of a different form in the sentence[d]𓐍:𓂋𓀁° 𓏲:𓏏𓏤 𓂋:𓍿𓀀𓏪 𓎟:𓏏 𓆣:𓂋𓏲 𓈖:𓎡:𓏏*𓏰𓏭:𓏛[/d]<i>ḫr tỉ rmṯ nb ḫpr nkt</i> for reasons which will be discussed below. For now they will be left as "[k][...][/k]".<br><br>
		
		[k]ⲧⲙⲁⲁⲩ ⲧⲉⲧⲙⲓⲥⲉ; ⲧⲙⲟⲉⲓⲧ ⲧⲉⲧϯ-ⲏⲣ.<br>
		[...] [...] ⲣⲱⲙⲉ ⲛⲓⲙ [...] ⲛⲕⲁ; ⲣⲙ̄ⲣⲁϣ ⲡⲉⲧϣⲟⲣϫϥ̄.[/k]<br><br>
		
		This passage consists of three cleft sentences which correspond closely with Coptic, and an aorist sentence which does not correspond straightforwardly with Coptic, but can probably be reconstructed based on the evidence that exists. 
		
		<h3>The aorist prefix <i>ḫr</i></h3>
		
		In Demotic the aorist was usually written as <i>ḫr</i> + [i]a verb in the <i>sḏm⸗f</i> form[/i]. A periphrastic form <i>ḫr</i> + <i>ỉr</i> ("do" in <i>sḏm⸗f</i> form) + [i]a verb in the infinitive[/i] also existed and became increasingly common in the Roman period [c]dvs-87[/c]. It is the periphrastic form that survives in Coptic as [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ϣⲁ⸗[/k] [c]ce-251[/c] [c]vy-269a[/c]. The non-periphrastic <i>ḫr</i> + <i>sḏm⸗f</i> form is the one found in this passage, and it does not survive in Coptic, so the pronunciation must be reconstructed. The first uncertainty to look for is the vowel quality of <i>ḫr</i>.<br><br>
		
		First, the aorist forms in different Coptic dialects should be compared. Sahidic and Bohairic both have [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ϣⲁ⸗[/k], and Fayyumic is similarly [k]ϣⲁⲗⲉ-[/k], [k]ϣⲁ⸗[/k]. Sahidic also has some unusual forms attested [k]ⲉϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ⲛϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k], [k]ⲛϣⲁ⸗[/k] (this one in Fayyumic too). I do not know if the initial [k]ⲉ-[/k] and [k]ⲛ-[/k] are epenthetic, or if something else is occurring here.<br>
		Akhmimic and related dialects preserve a less reduced prepronominal form: Akhmimic [k]ⳉⲁⲣⲉ-[/k],  [k]ⳉⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k], Subakhmimic [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ-[/k],  [k]ϣⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k], and also Akhmimic-influenced Sahidic [k]ⲉϣⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k] [c]cd-583a[/c].<br>In all of these, the vowel immediately following [k]ϣ/ⳉ[/k] is consistently [k]ⲁ[/k] in both the pronominal and prepronominal forms, and between all dialects.<br><br>
		
		But because all of the above Coptic forms are derived from the periphrastic <i>ḫr ỉr⸗f</i>, they may not provide enough information to deduce the vowel quality of <i>ḫr</i> alone. Vowel reduction is very likely. This is seen in similar situations with auxiliary verbs; for example Allen reconstructs <i>ỉr⸗f sḏm</i> /i.ri.af.'sa.ḏam/ > [k]ⲁϥⲥⲱⲧⲙ[/k]  [c]aep-136[/c].<br><br>
		
		So it may be useful to compare other examples where a particle is attached to <i>ỉr⸗f</i>; especially those where the non-attached form survives as well, to see how the vowel quality is affected by the neighboring <i>ỉr⸗f</i>, and by possible reduction:<br><br>
		
		• The optative[d]𓅓𓇋𓇋𓏲[/d]<i>my</i> [i]<i>verb in sḏm⸗f</i>[/i] (&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁ-[/k]&nbsp;) and its periphrastic form[d]𓅓𓇋𓇋𓏲𓁹:𓂋*𓏭𓇋𓏲[/d]<i>my ỉre</i> [i]verb in infinitive[/i] (&nbsp;>&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ-[/k],&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k]&nbsp;) both survive in Coptic [c]ce-77, 88[/c] [c]dvs-139-142[/c]. All dialects have the same vowels in [k]ⲙⲁ-[/k] [c]cd-155b[/c] and [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ-[/k] (Fayyumic [k]ⲙⲁⲗⲉ-[/k]) [c]cd-182b[/c].<br>
		
		In addition to the unstressed <i>ỉr⸗f</i> form in [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ-[/k],&nbsp;[k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k], Coptic also preserves this construction with stressed <i>ỉr⸗f</i> form in [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲟⲛ[/k] "let us (go)" (&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>my ỉr⸗n</i>&nbsp;) [c]cd-182b[/c] [c]lambdin-135[/c].<br>
		The vowel quality [k]ⲁ[/k] in the first syllable does not change here regardless of whether <i>ỉr⸗n</i> is stressed (as in [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲟⲛ[/k]) or unstressed (as in [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉⲛ- / ⲙⲁⲣⲛ̄-[/k]).<br><br>
		
		The consistent vocalization of the aorist and optative forms across all dialects, and these similarities of the forms overall (such as Akhmimic [k]ⳉⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k] and [k]ⲙⲁⲣⲉ⸗[/k] respectively) suggest to me that the reading of <i>ḫr</i>, if it had survived in Coptic on its own, is probably [k]ϣⲁ-[/k] (Akhmimic&nbsp;[k]ⳉⲁ-[/k]).
		
		<h3>The <i>sḏm⸗f</i> after <i>ḫr</i></h3>
		
		<h3>The prospective <i>sḏm⸗f</i></h3>
		
		In a causative sentence such as <i>tỉ ... ḫpr </i>[i]noun[/i] "cause that [i]noun[/i] comes into being, i.e. acquire [i]noun[/i]", the second verb is a prospective <i>sḏm⸗f</i> [c]two-84[/c]. The vocalization of this construction is preserved in Coptic in the form of the large T-causative family of infinitives. [c]lambdin-112-114[/c]
