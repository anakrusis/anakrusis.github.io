They are similarly discrete bits of material that take up space and can be stepped on. The similarity is visible in the earlier Egyptian form[h]𓇿𓂋𓂧𓂾𓊍[/h]<i>tꜣ-rd</i> \"stairway, ramp\" [c]ce|195[/c] with the[h]𓊍[/h]determinative. In this case, there is the issue of what to call the actual stairs blocks, for which [k]ⲧⲱⲣⲧ[/k] would have been a good fit; perhaps [k]ⲧⲱⲣⲧⲣ̄[/k] can be used here.<br><br>[k]<b>• ⲧⲱⲱⲃⲉ: </b>[/k]\"brick\" [c]cd|398a[/c][c]ce|181[/c]. It is used sometimes with the material specified after (in the same way we might say in the game \"block of X\" or \"X block\"— [k]ⲧⲱⲱⲃⲉ ⲛ̄[/k] X), so it sounds like a good contender for this generic term. Examples of this construction:<br><br>[k]ⲁⲩⲱ ⲡⲙⲁ ⲉⲧϩⲁⲛⲉϥⲟⲩⲉⲣⲏⲧⲉ ⲉϥⲟ ⲛ̄ⲧϩⲉ ⲛ̄ⲟⲩϩⲱⲃ ⲛ̄<b>ⲧⲱⲃⲉ</b> ⲛ̄ⲥⲁⲡⲡⲓⲣⲟⲛ[/k]<br>\"and under his feet was as it were a work of sapphire <b>slabs</b>\" ([s]exo24-10[/s])<br>(It demonstrates that the [k]ⲧⲱⲱⲃⲉ[/k] is not limited to mud/clay-like materials, and if chosen, [k]ⲧⲱⲱⲃⲉ ⲛ̄ⲥⲁⲡⲡⲓⲣⲟⲛ[/k] would be used as the word for the Lapis Lazuli Block— see [r]item.dyePowder.blue.name[/r]) <br><br>[k]ⲟⲩ<b>ⲧⲱⲱⲃⲉ</b> ⲛ̄ⲟⲙⲉ ⲉⲩϣⲁⲛⲛⲟϫⲥ ⲉⲩⲥⲛ̄ⲧⲉ ϩⲁⲧⲙ̄ⲡⲓⲉⲣⲟ . ⲛ̄ⲥⲛⲁϩⲩⲡⲟⲙⲓⲛⲉ ⲁⲛ ⲛ̄ⲟⲩϩⲟⲟⲩ ⲛ̄ⲟⲩⲱⲧ[/k]<br>\"A mud <b>brick</b> that is laid as a foundation by the river will not last a single day.\" (Apa Orsisius, Apophthegmata Patrum)<br><br>Compared to the other translations,  using a word for \"brick\" to translate the word \"block\" is atypical. One issue that arises from this is what to call the actual brick items and brick blocks. I might suggest here [k]ⲧⲉⲣⲡⲟⲥⲉ[/k] “baked brick” [c]ce|195[/c][c]lambdin|282[/c] which is accurate to how they are made in the game as well.<br><br>[k]<b>• ⲕⲩⲃⲟⲥ: </b>[/k]This word could be widely understood by players, but the problem is that it is not attested in Coptic as far as I know. It is from the Greek word κύβος \"cube\", which did spread to other contemporaneous languages such as Latin&nbsp;<i>cubus</i> (Beekes&nbsp;795) and Syriac&nbsp;ܩܘܒܘܣ&nbsp<i>qwbws</i> (Smith 491b). The Modern Greek and Latin translations of the game have κύβος and <i>cubus</i> for \"block\". These are not the only languages which have translated \"block\" using a word for \"cube\"; Finnish&nbsp;<i>kuutio</i> does as well. <br><br>[k]<b>• ⲡⲗⲟⲕ: </b>[/k]",

But there is still uncertainty over how and when this cactus arrived in Africa. If it happened during the period of early modern trade with the Americas, then a Coptic word for cactus is unlikely to have existed. But if <i>R. baccifera</i> has been there since antiquity or earlier, then it is possible a Coptic word exists for it. Here are some ideas:<br><br>[k]<b>• ⲁⲗ: </b>[/k]\"<i>cactus</i> الصبَّارة\" [c]ma|2[/c], both Sahidic and Bohairic. I do not know of any texts where this word is attested in (if anyone knows where, I would greatly appreciate it).

Compare Armenian կակտուս <i>kaktus</i>, Hebrew קקטוס <i>kaktus</i>, Latin <i>cactus</i>, Persian کاکتوس <i>kâktus</i>, etc. But it is not attested in Coptic, and this would be a neologism (though widely understood).<br><br>It should also be noted that many other kinds of succulent plants can be found in the region, and the one true cactus which may be native does not really resemble the Minecraft cactus. So an exact match is probably not going to happen, and it's okay to be flexible when choosing a word for it. ",

Although I was previously aware of the word and added it to the resource pack back in November 2023, ℝandy 𓉑's research was what resolved a lot of the uncertainty I had, so I am very thankful for their hard work.<br><br>The sources I had seen previously were giving me mixed signals, because [k]<b>ⲁⲩⲁⲛ ⲙ̄ⲡⲉ</b>[/k] seems to either refer to the color, and/or an indirect reference to linen: \"sky-colored, blue\" [c]cd|20b, 259a[/c], \"	linen (\'colour of the sky\')\" [c]cdo|C243[/c] \"sky-blue\" [c]lambdin|256[/c], \"sky-colour, blue لون سماوي\" [c]ma|290, 491a[/c], \"material from which clothes are made = linen\" [c]vy|19[/c].<br>Vycichl explains that this is in reference to the blue flowers of certain species of flax, such as <i>Linum humile</i> (= <i>Linum usitatissimum</i>). Although flax is usually called <i>mḥꜥ</i> (> [k]ⲙⲁϩⲉ[/k]), this is essentially a poetic name for it.<br><br>There are at least three attestations of [k]ⲁⲩⲁⲛ ⲙ̄ⲡⲉ[/k], and ℝandy 𓉑 found two of them. The first is from a codex at the Morgan Library:<br><br>[k]ⲉⲧⲃⲉⲟⲩ ⲧⲉⲧⲛⲉⲡⲉⲑⲩⲙⲉⲓ ⲉϩⲉⲛϩⲟⲉⲓⲧⲉ ⲙⲡⲉⲣⲩⲕⲓⲟⲛ ⲙⲛϩⲉⲛ<b>ⲁⲩⲁⲛ ⲙⲡⲉ</b> ⲙⲛϩⲉⲛϣⲉⲛⲥ ⲙⲛϩⲉⲛ(ⲕ?...ⲡⲁⲥⲓⲛⲛⲟⲥ?) ⲉⲧⲉⲧⲛⲟⲩⲟⲛϩ ⲉⲃⲟⲗ ϩⲛⲧⲉⲕⲕⲏⲥⲓⲁ ⲉⲧⲉⲧⲛⲫⲟⲣⲉⲓ ⲙⲙⲟⲟⲩ [ⲉ]ⲧⲉⲧⲛⲙⲏⲣ ⲉϫⲛⲛⲉ[ⲧ]ⲛϯⲡⲉ ⲛϩⲉⲛⲫⲓⲃ?[...] ⲛⲛⲟⲩⲃ[/k]<br>Why do you desire garments of (perykion?), and <b>linen</b>, and fine linen, and (k?...pasinnos?) while you are visible in church, wearing them as you are girt about your loins with golden (phib?...)s... (Codex M 602, folio 46)<br><br>This was my attempt at roughly translating it. In this context [k]ⲁⲩⲁⲛ ⲙ̄ⲡⲉ[/k] refers to one of several fabrics for clothing, so I translated it as \"linen\" in agreement with the above definitions. And alongside it is [k]ϣⲉⲛⲥ[/k], which refers to a kind of linen made with fine flax [c]cd|572a[/c] [c]cdo|C5948[/c].<br><br>The other attestation which ℝandy 𓉑 found is in Apocalypse of Paul, which was included in Budge's <i>Miscellaneous Coptic texts in the dialect of Upper Egypt</i> (p. 570, <i>AoP</i> folio 35a):<br><br>[k]ⲁⲩⲱ ⲡⲡⲁⲣⲁⲇⲉⲓⲥⲟⲥ ⲧⲏⲣϥ̄ ⲛⲉϥⲟ̄ ⲛ̄ ⲟ̄ⲉⲓⲛ ⲙ̄ⲡ<b>ⲁⲩⲁⲛ ⲙ̄ⲡⲉ</b> · ⲛ̄ⲑⲉ ⲙ̄ⲡⲛⲁⲩ ⲙⲙⲉⲉⲣⲉ ⲉⲙⲛ̄ ⲕⲁⲕⲉ ⲛ̄ϩⲏⲧϥ̄ · ⲁⲗⲗⲁ ⲡⲟⲩⲟ̄ⲉⲓⲛ ⲙ̄ⲡⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ ⲡⲉⲧ ϣⲟⲟⲡ ⲛ̄ϩⲏⲧ ⲛ̄ⲛⲁⲩ ⲛⲓⲙ[/k]<br>And all of Paradise was shining <b>sky blue</b>, like noontime with no darkness in it, but rather it was the light of God in all times<br>And all the Paradise was [lighted with] <b>caerulean blue</b> light, and this light was like unto that of noonday wherein there is no greyness, and the light of God was in it always<br><br>I tried translating this one too before I saw Budge's translation at the end. Budge gave the translation of \"caerulean blue\", and I gave \"sky blue\", both of which agree with the above definitions. In this context there is nothing to do with fabrics, but rather the color of light. And the context thankfully clears up any doubts of whether it might refer to a dark blue of the night sky or at twilight; it is the light blue of the sky at noon.<br><br>So [k]ⲁⲩⲁⲛ ⲙ̄ⲡⲉ[/k] is not exclusively used to refer to linen, and in reference to the color of the flax flower and the sky at noon, its usage suggests a light blue color. Thank you again to ℝandy 𓉑 whose hard work finding the attestations has made this possible!",

None of these usages are close in meaning to the grass intended.<br><br>When referring to grass or herbs in the general sense, as occurs throughout the Bible for example, while Bohairic texts do use [k]ⲥⲓⲙ[/k] in this way, the Sahidic parallels have the Greek [k]<b>ⲭⲟⲣⲧⲟⲥ</b>[/k] [c]cdo|C10977[/c] instead. This word is very common; ANNIS search returns 58 uses in 48 documents.

(Mark 6:39 more specifically calls it [k]ⲭⲟⲣⲧⲟⲥ ⲉⲧ[r]color.green|ⲟⲩⲉⲧⲟⲩⲱⲧ|true[/r][/k] \"green grass\".) This is the kind of grass that covers the ground, like in a Minecraft world-- [k]ⲡⲉⲭⲟⲣⲧⲟⲥ ⲉⲧϩⲛ̄ⲧⲥⲱϣⲉ[/k] \"the grass in the field\" (Luke 12:28), in other words.<br><br>I also checked the Bohairic equivalents of all these passages, and every one has [k]ⲥⲓⲙ[/k] in the same places where Sahidic has [k]ⲭⲟⲣⲧⲟⲥ[/k]. Although there are nuances in usage, such as the aforementioned specific herbs and oils, these two words are apparently synonymous. This is not a matter of which word is more correct, but rather which is more typical of the dialect being used, and which a reader familiar with that dialect will more likely understand. So a Sahidic Minecraft translation will use what is typical of Sahidic, [k]ⲭⲟⲣⲧⲟⲥ[/k], and a Bohairic translation will use [k]ⲥⲓⲙ[/k].",

The Bohairic translations also agree with this and never use [k]ϩⲩⲁⲕⲓⲛⲑⲓⲛⲟⲛ[/k] and [k]ϭⲏϫⲓ[/k] interchangeably. The word in question appears consistently in all the same places in the Bohairic versions, except that Bohairic always has [k]ϩⲩⲁⲕⲓⲛⲑⲓⲛⲟⲛ[/k] instead of [k]ϩⲩⲁⲕⲓⲛⲑⲟⲥ[/k]. This form is used not just as as color modifying other nouns, but also as a noun on its own: the jacinth precious stone also called [k]ϩⲩⲁⲕⲓⲛⲑⲓⲛⲟⲛ[/k] (Revelation 21:20) in Bohairic and Sahidic.<br><br>The question of whether [k]ϩⲩⲁⲕⲓⲛⲑⲓⲛⲟⲛ[/k] is more blueish or purplish remains uncertain. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinthus_orientalis\">hyacinth flower</a> which the word refers to can be either color, although it seems to tend more often toward violet. The imprecision in meaning of this word is exacerbated by the fact that I am reading translations of translations from Hebrew to Greek to Coptic and English. Maybe the original Hebrew word will be more clear cut... <br><br>In Hebrew this color is תכלת <i>tekhelet</i>. It is not more clear cut. For example, in <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/hebrew/8504.htm\">Strong's Concordance 8504</a>: \"violet, violet thread... Probably for shcheleth; the cerulean mussel, i.e. The color (violet) obtained therefrom or stuff dyed therewith -- blue.\"<br>Many translate this word as \"blue\" but there is still no consensus. While browsing Sefaria I saw also \"purple\" (Sefaria community translation of Sirach), \"blue-violet\" (Exodus in The Schocken Bible), and even \"greenish blue\" (Metsudah Publications). In Modern Hebrew it has taken on the meaning of \"light blue\". <br><br>I think this color [k]ϩⲩⲁⲕⲓⲛⲑⲓⲛⲟⲛ[/k]&nbsp;/&nbsp;תכלת is ambiguous, but not unusably so. It can refer to blue and it can refer to violet or purple, and both uses of the word would be more or less fine. The points of reference, both the tekhelet dye process and the hyacinth flower, vary in color, so it probably covered a range of hues even back in the time when the texts were written. Just about the only thing constant is that [k]ϩⲩⲁⲕⲓⲛⲑⲓⲛⲟⲛ[/k]&nbsp;/&nbsp;תכלת is not the same color as [k]ϫⲏϭⲉ[/k]&nbsp;/&nbsp;ארגמן. <br><br>~~~<br><br>Another word is [k]<b>ⲥⲁⲡⲡⲉⲓⲣⲓⲛⲟⲛ</b>[/k] \"sapphire-blue\" [c]cdo|C10406[/c], which is much less ambiguous in hue, but also a much rarer word. It is derived from [r]item.dyePowder.blue.name[/r], which is the material used to dye objects this same blue color in Minecraft, so this would be a fitting name for it.<br><br>Finding where this word is attested is difficult. It must be in at least two different places, because it appears with two different spellings [k]ⲥⲁⲡⲡⲉⲓⲣⲓⲛⲟⲛ[/k] and [k]ⲥⲁⲡⲫⲉⲓⲣⲓⲛⲟⲥ[/k] in Cherix's <a href=\"https://coptica.ch/Cherix-Variantes.pdf#page=318\"><i>Les variantes coptes</a></i> (p. 316b). One of these attestations is in the Nag Hammadi codices:<br><br>[k]ⲕⲱ ⲛ̄ⲇⲉ ⲛ̄ⲟⲩ[r]tile.stone.stone.name|ⲱⲛⲉ|true[/r] ⲛ̄ⲅⲁⲗⲁⲕⲧⲓⲧⲏⲥ ⲙ̄ⲡⲓⲧⲛ̄ ⲛ̄ⲛ̄ⲡⲗⲁⲝ ⲛ̄ⲕⲁⲗⲗⲁⲉⲓⲛⲏ ⲉϥⲉ ⲛ̄ⲧⲉⲧⲣⲁⲅⲱⲛⲟⲛ ⲛ̄ⲅⲥϩⲁⲓ ⲡⲣⲁⲛ ⲉⲧⲡⲗⲁⲝ ⲛ̄[r]tile.stone.stone.name|ⲱⲛⲉ|true[/r] ⲛ̄<b>ⲥⲁⲡⲡⲉⲓⲣⲓⲛⲟⲛ</b> ϩⲛ̄ϩⲛ̄ⲥϩⲁⲉⲓ ⲛ̄ⲥⲁϩⲡⲣⲁⲉⲓϣ[/k]<br>And put a square milk-[r]tile.stone.stone.name|stone|true[/r] at the base of the turquoise tablets, and write the name on the <b>azure</b> [r]tile.stone.stone.name|stone|true[/r] tablet in hieroglyphic characters. (Codex VI, <i>The Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth</i> p.62)<br><br>I can't find the other attestation(s) of this word. Despite being unfortunately difficult to find, I like that the meaning is quite transparent; its relation to the lapis lazuli from which the blue color is made is a nice bonus. But I'm not sure that such an uncommon word, of which I could find just one attestation, is suitable for such a common concept as the color <i>blue</i>.",
